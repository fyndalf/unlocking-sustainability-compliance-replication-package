TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS FOR WATER APPLIANCES

1. The flow rate is recorded at the standard reference pressure 3 -0/+ 0,2 bar or 0,1 -0/+0,02 for products limited to low pressure.
2. The flow rate at the lower pressure 1,5 -0/+ 0,2 bar is ≥ 60 % of the maximum available flow rate.
3. For mixer showers, the reference temperature is 38 ± 1 ̊ C.
4. Where the flow has to be lower than 6 L/min, it complies with the rule set out in point 2.
5. For taps the procedure described in clause 10.2.3 of EN 200 is followed, with the following exceptions:
(a) for taps that are not limited to low pressure applications only: apply a 3 -0/+ 0,2 bar pressure to both the hot and the cold inlets, alternatively;
(b) for taps that are limited to low pressure applications only: apply a 0,4 -0/+0,02 bar pressure to both the hot and the cold inlets and fully open the flow control.
