GENERIC CRITERIA FOR DNSH TO SUSTAINABLE USE AND PROTECTION OF WATER AND MARINE RESOURCES

Environmental degradation risks related to preserving water quality and avoiding water stress are identified and addressed with the aim of achieving good water status and good ecological potential as defined in Article 2, points (22) and (23), of Regulation (EU) 2020/852, in accordance with Directive 2000/60/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council364 and a water use and protection management plan, developed thereunder for the potentially affected water body or bodies, in consultation with relevant stakeholders.
Where an Environmental Impact Assessment is carried out in accordance with Directive 2011/92/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council365 and includes an assessment of the impact on water in accordance with Directive 2000/60/EC, no additional assessment of impact on water is required, provided the risks identified have been addressed.
The activity does not hamper the achievement of good environmental status of marine waters or does not deteriorate marine waters that are already in good environmental status as defined in point 5 of Article 3 of Directive 2008/56/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council366,367, taking into account the Commission Decision (EU) 2017/848368 in relation to the relevant criteria and methodological standards  or those descriptors

For activities in third countries, in accordance with applicable national law or international standards which pursue equivalent objectives of good water status and good ecological potential, through equivalent procedural and substantive rules, i.e. a water use and protection management plan developed in consultation with relevant stakeholders which ensures that 1) the impact of the activities on the identified status or ecological potential of potentially affected water body or bodies is assessed and 2) deterioration or prevention of good status/ecological potential is avoided or, where this is not possible, 3) justified by the lack of better environmental alternatives which are not disproportionately costly/technically unfeasible, and all practicable steps are taken to mitigate the adverse impact on the status of the body of water.
365 Directive 2011/92/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 December 2011 on the assessment of the effects of certain public and private projects on the environment (OJ L 26, 28.1.2012, p. 1). 366 Directive 2008/56/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 June 2008 establishing a framework for community action in the field of marine environmental policy (Marine Strategy Framework Directive) (OJ L 164, 25.6.2008, p. 19).
367 The definition laid down in point 5 of Article 3 of Directive 2008/56/EC provides in particular that good environmental status is to be determined on the basis of the qualitative descriptors laid down in Annex I to that Directive.
