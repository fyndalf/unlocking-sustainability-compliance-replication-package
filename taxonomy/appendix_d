Where an EIA has been carried out, the required mitigation and compensation measures for protecting the environment are implemented.
For sites/operations located in or near biodiversity-sensitive areas (including the Natura 2000 network of protected areas, UNESCO World Heritage sites and Key Biodiversity Areas, as well as other protected areas), an appropriate assessment335, where applicable, has been conducted and based on its conclusions the necessary mitigation measures336 are implemented.
